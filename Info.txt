D3 (or D3.js) is a free, open-source JavaScript library for visualizing data. Its low-level approach built on web standards offers unparalleled flexibility in authoring dynamic, data-driven graphics.


D3 is a low-level toolbox

D3 is not a charting library in the traditional sense. It has no concept of “charts”. When you visualize data with D3, you compose a variety of primitives.

To make a stacked area chart, you might use

a CSV parser to load data,
a time scale for horizontal position (x),
a linear scale for vertical position (y),
an ordinal scale and categorical scheme for color,
a stack layout for arranging values,
an area shape with a linear curve for generating SVG path data,
axes for documenting the position encodings, and
selections for creating SVG elements.


The name “D3” is short for data-driven documents, where documents refers to the Document Object Model (DOM) standard that represents the contents of a webpage.
